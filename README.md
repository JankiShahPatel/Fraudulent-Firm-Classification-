# Fraudulent-Firm-Classification

This dataset is taken from research to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis of the present and historical risk factors. The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as Irrigation (114), Public Health (77), Buildings and Roads (82), Forest (70), Corporate (47), Animal Husbandry (95), Communication (1), Electrical (4), Land (5), Science and Technology (3), Tourism (1), Fisheries (41), Industries (37), Agriculture (200).

There are two CSV files Audit_Risk and Trial. We have considered ``Audit_Risk`` as target column for regression tasks, and ``Risk`` as the target column for classification tasks.
